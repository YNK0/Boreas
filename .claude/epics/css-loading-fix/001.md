# Task: CSS Pipeline Diagnosis

## Description

**CRITICAL P0:** Rapidly diagnose why Tailwind CSS styles are not loading at all in the Boreas application. Identify the exact root cause of the complete CSS absence to enable targeted fix in subsequent tasks.

This is a diagnostic task that must be completed first before any fixes are attempted. The goal is to understand exactly where the CSS pipeline breaks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Confirmed CSS files are/aren't being generated in .next/ directory
- [ ] Verified Tailwind compilation process is working/failing
- [ ] Identified specific error messages or failure points
- [ ] Documented browser DevTools findings (Network tab, Console)
- [ ] Confirmed package.json dependencies are correctly installed
- [ ] Root cause clearly identified and documented

## Technical Details

**Investigation Approach:**
1. **Browser DevTools Analysis**
   - Check Network tab for failed CSS requests
   - Inspect Console for CSS-related errors
   - Verify if CSS files are being requested at all
   - Check Response status for any CSS file requests

2. **Build Output Inspection**
   - Examine `.next/static/css/` directory for generated CSS files
   - Check file sizes and content of any generated CSS
   - Verify CSS files contain Tailwind classes and custom styles

3. **Configuration File Audit**
   - Validate `tailwind.config.ts` syntax and content paths
   - Check for `postcss.config.js` existence and configuration
   - Verify `package.json` has correct Tailwind and PostCSS dependencies

4. **Manual Compilation Test**
   - Test Tailwind CLI compilation outside Next.js
   - Verify CSS directives in `src/app/globals.css` are correct
   - Check for any obvious syntax errors in CSS files

**Key Areas to Investigate:**
- File paths in `tailwind.config.ts` content array
- PostCSS plugin configuration
- Next.js CSS import resolution
- Node modules installation integrity

**Code Locations:**
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Content paths and configuration
- `src/app/globals.css` - Tailwind directives
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - CSS import statement
- `package.json` - Dependencies and versions
- `.next/` directory - Build output inspection

## Dependencies

- [ ] Access to development environment and browser DevTools
- [ ] Node.js and npm commands available
- [ ] Current project state preserved for investigation

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** XS
- **Hours:** 0.25-0.5 hours (15-30 minutes)
- **Parallel:** false (must complete first)

**Breakdown:**
- Browser inspection: 5-10 minutes
- Build output analysis: 5-10 minutes
- Configuration review: 10-15 minutes
- Documentation: 5 minutes

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Root cause clearly identified and documented
- [ ] Specific failure point in CSS pipeline located
- [ ] Browser DevTools screenshots captured
- [ ] Configuration issues (if any) documented
- [ ] Clear path forward for fix tasks established
- [ ] Findings documented in task comments or separate file

## Priority & Urgency

**Priority:** P0 - Critical Blocker
**Urgency:** Immediate - Must complete before any other tasks
**Impact:** Entire application unusable without this diagnosis

## Expected Outcomes

**Most Likely Root Causes:**
1. **Tailwind Config Issue:** Content paths don't match actual file locations
2. **PostCSS Configuration:** Missing or incorrect postcss.config.js
3. **Import Statement:** CSS import path incorrect in layout.tsx
4. **Build Process:** Next.js not processing CSS directives correctly
5. **Dependency Issue:** Missing or corrupted node_modules packages

**Success Criteria:**
- Exact cause identified within 30 minutes
- Clear technical explanation of why CSS isn't loading
- Actionable next steps for fix tasks
