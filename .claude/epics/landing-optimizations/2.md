# Performance Monitoring Setup

## Objective
Establish comprehensive performance monitoring infrastructure to track Core Web Vitals and ensure optimization effectiveness.

## Description
Set up monitoring tools and CI/CD integration to continuously track landing page performance metrics. This foundation will enable data-driven optimization decisions and prevent performance regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Google PageSpeed Monitoring
- [ ] Integrate Google PageSpeed Insights API
- [ ] Set up automated daily performance reports
- [ ] Configure alerts for performance score drops below 90
- [ ] Track metrics for mobile and desktop separately

### Lighthouse CI Integration
- [ ] Configure Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up performance budget enforcement
- [ ] Block PRs that degrade Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Generate visual regression reports

### Core Web Vitals Measurement
- [ ] Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- [ ] Track LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
- [ ] Monitor FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
- [ ] Measure CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
- [ ] Set up Web Vitals reporting dashboard

### Performance Budget Enforcement
- [ ] Define size budgets for critical resources
- [ ] Set timing budgets for key user journeys
- [ ] Configure webpack-bundle-analyzer
- [ ] Implement bundle size monitoring alerts

## Technical Implementation

### Tools Required
- Google PageSpeed Insights API
- Lighthouse CI
- Web Vitals library
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer
- GitHub Actions

### Configuration Files
- `.lighthouserc.js` - Lighthouse CI configuration
- `performance-budget.json` - Resource size limits
- `.github/workflows/performance.yml` - CI workflow

### Monitoring Endpoints
- Landing page variants (salon, restaurant, clinic, etc.)
- Contact forms and CTA flows
- Mobile and desktop viewports

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance monitoring pipeline active
- [ ] Baseline metrics established for all page variants
- [ ] Automated alerts configured
- [ ] Performance reports accessible to team
- [ ] CI/CD blocks performance regressions

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational task

## Estimated Effort
**4-6 hours**

## Notes
- Focus on Core Web Vitals as primary metrics
- Ensure monitoring covers all business type variants
- Set realistic but challenging performance budgets
- Document monitoring setup for team reference
