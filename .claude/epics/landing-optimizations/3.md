# Image Optimization & WebP Implementation

## Objective
Optimize all landing page images for maximum performance while maintaining visual quality, implementing modern formats and lazy loading.

## Description
Convert existing images to WebP format, implement Next.js Image component optimization, and set up intelligent lazy loading to dramatically reduce initial page load times and improve Core Web Vitals.

## Acceptance Criteria

### WebP Format Conversion
- [ ] Convert all hero images to WebP with fallbacks
- [ ] Optimize business type showcase images
- [ ] Convert testimonial photos and logos
- [ ] Implement progressive JPEG fallbacks for older browsers
- [ ] Achieve 40-60% size reduction vs original formats

### Next.js Image Optimization
- [ ] Replace all `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` component
- [ ] Configure responsive image sizes
- [ ] Set up automatic format detection
- [ ] Implement blur-up placeholders
- [ ] Enable automatic size optimization

### Lazy Loading Strategy
- [ ] Lazy load all non-critical images (below fold)
- [ ] Prioritize hero and CTA images for immediate loading
- [ ] Implement intersection observer for progressive loading
- [ ] Configure loading="eager" for above-fold content
- [ ] Set up preload hints for critical images

### Responsive Image Sizing
- [ ] Define breakpoint-specific image sizes
- [ ] Implement art direction for different viewports
- [ ] Optimize images for 1x, 2x, and 3x pixel densities
- [ ] Configure Next.js responsive image loader
- [ ] Test on various device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Image Processing Pipeline
```bash
# WebP conversion with quality optimization
npx @squoosh/cli --webp '{"quality":85}' src/images/*.{jpg,png}
```

### Next.js Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['domain.com'],
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384]
  }
}
```

### Critical Images List
- Hero section backgrounds (per business type)
- Primary CTA button backgrounds
- Logo and brand assets
- First testimonial image

### Lazy Loading Implementation
- Use Next.js Image component's built-in lazy loading
- Configure priority prop for critical images
- Implement custom loading states for UX
- Add error fallbacks for broken images

## Performance Targets

### File Size Reduction
- Hero images: < 150KB (currently ~400KB)
- Showcase images: < 100KB each
- Testimonial photos: < 50KB each
- Total image payload: < 500KB for initial load

### Loading Performance
- LCP improvement: 1-2 seconds reduction
- Reduce total image blocking time by 60%
- Achieve image optimization score > 95 in Lighthouse

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All images converted to optimized formats
- [ ] Next.js Image component implemented throughout
- [ ] Lazy loading active for non-critical images
- [ ] Responsive images working across all devices
- [ ] Image performance targets achieved
- [ ] Lighthouse image optimization score > 95

## Dependencies
None - can run in parallel with other optimizations

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours**

## Notes
- Test WebP support across target browsers
- Maintain visual quality while optimizing file sizes
- Document image optimization process for future assets
- Consider using next/dynamic for image-heavy components
